# Purely Algorithmic CSS layouts

This a is series of drills to learn and demonstrate CSS layouts that are fully responsive and self-adjusting without using any (zero, nada, zip!) `@media` queries. The UI library is `react`.

Demo:

## Based on the Every Layout design system

The dirll is entirely based on `Every Layout` , a design system created by Heydon Pickering and Andy Bell.

This system achieves maximum responsiveness with minimum `css` by having the browser's algorithms do the heavily lifting instead of the highly prescriptive `@media` queries and absolute measures.
